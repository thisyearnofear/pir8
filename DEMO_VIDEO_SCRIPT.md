## 🎯 Script Outline

### Introduction (20 seconds)
**[Screen: PIR8 main menu with pirate theme]**

> "Hi! I'm excited to show you PIR8—a game that teaches blockchain privacy through play.
> 
> On transparent blockchains, every transaction is public. Analytics firms track your moves, MEV bots front-run your trades, and your strategies become predictable.
> 
> PIR8 makes you **experience** this firsthand."

**Show**: Main menu, pirate map background

---

### The Problem (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Start Practice Mode, show initial game board]**

> "Let me show you what information leakage looks like.
> 
> I'm playing against an AI opponent in Practice Mode. Watch this Privacy Leakage Meter on the right.
> 
> Every move I make—capturing territory, gathering resources, moving ships—the meter goes up.
> 
> Why? Because on transparent blockchains, all this information is visible. The AI can see my patterns and predict my strategy."

**Show**: 
- Privacy Leakage Meter at 0%
- Make 2-3 moves
- Watch meter increase to 40-50%
- Highlight visible ship positions

---

### AI Profiling Demo (40 seconds)
**[Screen: Make several moves, then open Player Dossier]**

> "After just a few turns, the AI has built a complete profile of my play style.
> 
> Click on 'View Dossier'...
> 
> It knows I'm aggressive, resource-focused, and 73% predictable. It's identified my patterns—I always open in the northeast, I prefer gold over wood, and I attack on turn 5.
> 
> This is exactly what happens on real blockchains. Chainalysis, Nansen, TRM Labs—they build these profiles from your transaction history. MEV bots use this to front-run your trades."

**Show**:
- Player Dossier modal
- Predictability score
- Pattern list
- Play style classification

---

### Privacy Lesson (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Trigger a privacy lesson modal]**

> "PIR8 teaches you these concepts through interactive lessons.
> 
> Here's one appearing now: 'Pattern Recognition Attack.'
> 
> It explains how the AI predicted my move—and how this relates to MEV attacks, sandwich attacks, and front-running in DeFi.
> 
> Every lesson includes real blockchain examples, connecting game mechanics to actual privacy concepts."

**Show**:
- Privacy Lesson modal
- Title: "Pattern Recognition Attack"
- Content with blockchain context
- Real-world examples section

---

### Ghost Fleet Solution (40 seconds)
**[Screen: Activate Ghost Fleet, make moves]**

> "Now here's where it gets interesting. I'm activating Ghost Fleet—PIR8's privacy mode.
> 
> For the next 3 moves, my actions are completely hidden from the AI. It can't see where I move, what resources I collect, or what I'm planning.
> 
> Watch the Leakage Meter drop... the AI's predictions fail... and my Predictability Score plummets.
> 
> This simulates privacy-preserving technology like Zcash's shielded transactions or Solana's confidential transfers. **This is what blockchain privacy feels like.**"

**Show**:
- Click "Activate Ghost Fleet" button
- Privacy shield indicator appears
- Make 3 moves while shielded
- Leakage Meter drops
- Dossier shows "Unable to analyze"

---

### Technical Stack (15 seconds)
**[Screen: Quick code/architecture glimpse]**

> "PIR8 is built on Solana with Anchor, deployed to devnet. It uses Helius for RPC and transaction monitoring. The privacy simulation engine tracks information leakage in real-time and teaches actual cryptography concepts."

**Show**:
- Quick terminal view: `solana program show [PROGRAM_ID]`
- Code snippet of privacySimulation.ts
- Helius integration in monitoring.ts

---

### Call to Action (5 seconds)
**[Screen: GitHub repo and links]**

> "PIR8 is open source on GitHub. Try it yourself, learn about blockchain privacy, and experience what information leakage really means.
> 
> Thanks for watching!"

**Show**:
- GitHub URL: github.com/thisyearnofear/pir8
- Project tagline: "Privacy Education Through Gaming"
