# Practice Mode Privacy Experience Design

## Overview
Transform practice mode from a simple "demo" into an **educational experience** that teaches users the value of privacy features by making them *feel* the pain of playing without privacy, then offering a path to the protected experience.

## Core Philosophy: "Feel the Pain, Then the Relief"

Instead of just telling users "privacy is good," we let them experience:
1. **The Transparent World** (Practice Mode) - Everything is visible, predictable, exploitable
2. **The Private World** (On-Chain + Session Keys) - Strategic depth, true unpredictability, fair play

---

## Current Practice Mode Analysis

### What's Working
- AI opponents with difficulty levels (novice → admiral)
- Full game mechanics (movement, combat, territory, building)
- Local state persistence
- No wallet required = zero friction entry

### What's Missing
- No demonstration of privacy value proposition
- AI feels "unfair" in transparent mode (can see everything)
- No differentiation from on-chain experience
- Missing the "aha moment" that drives conversion

---

## Privacy-Teaching Game Mechanics

### 1. The "Spyglass" System (Information Asymmetry Demo)

**Concept**: In practice mode, the AI has perfect information about player moves, simulating what happens on a transparent blockchain.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface SpyglassSystem {
  // AI knows your moves before you make them
  aiPredictionAccuracy: number; // 80% in practice mode
  
  // Visual indicator: AI "predicts" your move
  showAIPrediction: boolean;
  
  // After each AI turn, reveal what they knew
  revealPostTurn: {
    yourIntendedMove: string;
    aiCounterStrategy: string;
    outcome: 'countered' | 'anticipated' | 'surprised';
  };
}
```

**UX Flow**:
1. Player plans move
2. UI shows: "🕵️ AI Pirate is watching your fleet movements..."
3. AI moves to counter position
4. Post-turn reveal: "AI knew you were heading to (3,4) because your ships were visible"
5. Educational tooltip: "On the transparent blockchain, opponents can track your wallet and predict your moves"

### 2. The "Bounty Board" (Transaction Tracking Demo)

**Concept**: Show how transparent transactions reveal strategy

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface BountyBoard {
  // AI maintains a "profile" of player behavior
  playerBehaviorProfile: {
    preferredShipTypes: string[];
    commonAttackPatterns: string[];
    resourceHoardingLocations: Coordinate[];
    typicalPlayTimes: number[]; // time of day patterns
  };
  
  // AI uses this to counter player
  aiAdaptationLevel: number; // increases as AI learns
  
  // Visual: Show the "dossier" AI has built
  showPlayerDossier: boolean;
}
```

**UX Flow**:
1. After 3-5 turns, show "📋 AI Pirate Dossier on You"
2. List: "Prefers attacking from north", "Hoards gold at port (2,3)", "Always builds galleons first"
3. Next turn: AI exploits these patterns
4. Educational moment: "Your on-chain history creates a permanent profile that skilled opponents can exploit"

### 3. The "Leakage Meter" (Privacy Visualization)

**Concept**: Quantify how much information the player is "leaking"

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface LeakageMeter {
  // Calculate information leakage per turn
  informationLeaked: {
    positionRevealed: boolean;
    strategyRevealed: boolean;
    resourcesRevealed: boolean;
    timingPatternsRevealed: boolean;
  };
  
  // Aggregate score
  totalLeakageScore: number; // 0-100
  
  // Comparison to on-chain
  onChainEquivalent: string; // "This is like broadcasting your moves on Twitter"
}
```

**Visual Design**:
- Sidebar meter: "🔓 Information Leaked: 73%"
- Breakdown chart showing what's visible to AI
- Compare to: "🔒 With Session Key Privacy: 0% leakage"

### 4. The "Ghost Fleet" Tutorial (Privacy Feature Preview)

**Concept**: Give players a taste of what privacy enables

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface GhostFleetTutorial {
  // One-time tutorial where player gets privacy powers
  triggerTurn: number; // Turn 5
  
  // Player's moves become hidden from AI
  playerHasPrivacy: boolean;
  
  // AI makes suboptimal moves because it can't predict
  aiConfusionLevel: number;
  
  // Visual feedback
  showPrivacyEffect: boolean;
}
```

**UX Flow**:
1. Turn 5: "🎁 Tutorial Reward: Ghost Fleet Activated!"
2. Player's next 3 moves are hidden from AI
3. AI makes "mistakes" because it can't predict
4. Player wins the engagement
5. Reveal: "This is what session key privacy enables - true strategic surprise. Your main wallet identity never appears on the game."

### 5. The "Whale Watching" Scenario (MEV Demo)

**Concept**: Simulate MEV/front-running in a game context

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface WhaleWatchingScenario {
  // AI "watches" for player building ships
  aiSnipingEnabled: boolean;
  
  // When player starts building, AI rushes to claim nearby territory first
  snipeBehavior: {
    trigger: 'player_building' | 'player_moving' | 'player_collecting';
    aiResponse: 'rush_claim' | 'intercept' | 'undercut';
  };
  
  // Educational overlay
  showMEVExplanation: boolean;
}
```

**UX Flow**:
1. Player decides to build ship at port
2. AI immediately claims adjacent high-value territory
3. Message: "⚡ AI Pirate front-ran your expansion!"
4. Explanation: "On transparent chains, bots can see your transactions before they're confirmed and act first"
5. Solution preview: "With session key privacy, your identity is invisible — opponents can't link your moves to your main wallet"

## System Architecture

### Privacy Simulation Layer

```typescript
// New file: src/lib/privacySimulation.ts

export interface PrivacySimulationConfig {
  mode: 'transparent' | 'ghost_fleet_demo' | 'full_privacy';
  aiInformationAccess: 'complete' | 'partial' | 'none';
  showLeakageVisualization: boolean;
  enablePredictiveAI: boolean;
}

export class PrivacySimulator {
  // Simulates what information is visible to opponents
  static calculateInformationLeakage(
    playerAction: GameAction,
    gameState: GameState,
    privacyMode: PrivacyMode
  ): InformationLeakageReport;
  
  // Generates AI behavior based on information access
  static generateAIPrediction(
    aiPlayer: Player,
    visibleInformation: VisibleInformation,
    difficulty: AIDifficulty
  ): AIPrediction;
  
  // Creates educational content based on leakage
  static generatePrivacyLesson(
    leakageReport: InformationLeakageReport
  ): PrivacyLesson;
}
```

### Enhanced AI with Privacy Awareness

```typescript
// Extend existing AI in pirateGameEngine.ts

interface PrivacyAwareAI extends AIDifficulty {
  // How much AI knows about player
  playerInformationAccess: {
    shipPositions: boolean;
    resourceCounts: boolean;
    intendedMoves: boolean; // Only in transparent mode
    historicalPatterns: boolean;
  };
  
  // AI behavior modifiers
  behavior: {
    canCounterMoves: boolean;
    canSnipeTerritories: boolean;
    canPredictBuilds: boolean;
    adaptationRate: number;
  };
}
```

### Practice Mode State Extensions

```typescript
// Add to GameState or create PracticeModeState

interface PracticeModeMetadata {
  privacySimulation: {
    currentMode: PrivacySimulationMode;
    leakageScore: number;
    aiDossier: PlayerDossier;
    ghostFleetCharges: number; // Tutorial charges
  };
  
  educationalProgress: {
    lessonsViewed: string[];
    privacyConceptsDemonstrated: string[];
    conversionPromptsShown: number;
  };
  
  playerBehaviorProfile: {
    movesAnalyzed: number;
    patternsIdentified: string[];
    predictabilityScore: number;
  };
}
```

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Practice Mode Completion Rate**: % of users who finish a practice game
2. **Privacy Lesson Engagement**: % who interact with educational elements
3. **Conversion Rate**: % who connect wallet after practice mode
4. **Time to Conversion**: How quickly users convert after experiencing privacy demo
5. **Retention**: Do converted users play longer than direct-wallet users?

---

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Privacy simulation state stored alongside game state
- Separate from core game logic (adds layer, doesn't modify)
- Can be disabled for "pure" practice mode

### Performance
- AI prediction calculations happen async
- Leakage meter updates on turn change only
- No blockchain calls in practice mode

### Accessibility
- Educational content can be skipped
- Visual indicators have text alternatives
- Clear distinction between "demo" and "real" features
